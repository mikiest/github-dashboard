# GitHub Dashboard

Lightweight dashboard to keep an eye on pull requests across your favorite org repos. It‚Äôs vibe coded and built for folks who just want the signal without the fluff.

## What it does

* Track open or recently merged PRs with author, status, diff stats, pins, and filters for ‚ÄúMine‚Äù or ‚ÄúStale‚Äù.
* Highlight when you‚Äôre requested for review and surface recently merged work.
* Rank top reviewers over the last 24h, 7d, or 30d using GitHub‚Äôs GraphQL API, complete with a dedicated Reviewers view.

## Stack

* **Client**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, React Query, Framer Motion.
* **Server**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, `gh api graphql` under the hood.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies and start both apps:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   * API: `http://localhost:4000`
   * App: `http://localhost:5174`
2. (Optional) Run separately:
   ```bash
   cd server && npm run dev
   cd client && npm run dev
   ```

## Configure access

1. Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and tweak values if needed (org slug, ports, stale window, limits).
   * Set `STALE_PR_WINDOW_DAYS` to control how many days without updates qualifies an open PR as stale in the org overview (defaults to 14).
2. Log in with the GitHub CLI so the server can query data:
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   gh auth login -s=user -s=read:user -s=repo
   ```
   The extra `repo` scope is what lets the dashboard pull the reviewer leaderboard data.

## Using the dashboard

1. Log in with the GitHub CLI and launch the app. Your username and orgs load automatically.
2. If you belong to multiple orgs, pick one from the modal. Otherwise the app picks the only org for you.
3. Favorite repos via the picker; results persist in your browser.
4. Browse PRs, toggle open/merged, search, pin important ones, or jump to the reviewers tab for leaderboard vibes.

### Refresh cadence

Set the poll interval for PR data via the `VITE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` environment variable in `client/.env`. It defaults to 15000 milliseconds.

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure the server logs ‚ÄúAPI listening on http://localhost:4000‚Äù.
* Install the GitHub CLI and set `GH_BIN` in `.env` if it isn‚Äôt on your PATH.
* If rate-limited, increase `VITE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` or reduce the repo list.

Have fun and keep shipping. ‚ù§Ô∏è
